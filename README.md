## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Within the project directory, you can execute the following commands:

### `npm start`

Initiates the application in development mode.\
Access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your web browser.

The page automatically reloads upon any modifications.\
Lint errors, if any, are displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [test running](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for further details.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the application for production into the `build` folder.\
It optimizes the build for the best performance and includes minification with unique filenames.\
Your application is now ready for deployment!

For more details, see the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This action is irreversible!**

If you're dissatisfied with the current build tool and configurations, ejecting allows full control over them.\
However, this operation cannot be undone.

`eject` copies all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, enabling customization.\
All commands except `eject` remain functional, pointing to the copied scripts.

`eject` isn't mandatory. Create React App offers a curated feature set suitable for most deployments.
